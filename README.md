# Veteran5
Hai, Ruth &amp; Sharon

In this project we'll be working together to create one gigantic bash script called veteran.sh
The end goal is a bash script that can get 1 - 6 flags and perform all of the Hard Level tasks respectively!

--- VETERAN.SH ---

The veteran.sh file is a file that imports all of the other tasks and use getopts in order to create flags for each command.

Veteran.sh Usage:      ./Veteran.sh -[1-6] [Arguments relevant for the task chosen...] 

For example: ./Veteran -2 "test.txt" ";"

Will output the test file content fields seperated by ";"

-------------   !!! Important Notes !!!  -------------

1. Choose git startegy as a team - when and if to merge/rebase... 

2. Define remote work branches that will be in use.

3. Define local work branches for every team.

4. Make sure that everyone knows their responsabilities.

5. Communicate while working and before making significant changes.

6. Don't forget to test before pushing!

7. Don't forget Error handling!

8. If designed correctly, adding more tasks to the Veteran.sh should be very easy.
